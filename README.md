A Julia Package for Structural Equation Modeling

## Summary
The goal of this project will be to develop a software package in Julia that performs structural equation modeling. This is a species of statistical modeling approach that combines ideas from regression modeling and factor analysis. This approach is hugely popular in social sciences (e.g., psychology, political science, economics) where researchers are required to measure so-called latent variables.

## Contribution:
- This project will help grow the Julia package infrastructure, and hopefully draw more applied researchers to the language.
- Providing open-source tools that out-perform closed-source alternatives beneficial for science.
- This can serve as a learning opportunity for group members interested in learning more about best practices in software engineering.

## Approach
- Put everything on Github
- Parcel out the submodules to team members
- Use existing R package called lavaan as a reference and also baseline for performance (we expect Julia will vastly out-perform R).

## Challenges
- The implementation of this modeling approach is perhaps a challenge without diving in to the math, which can be a bit hairy. We can really lean on the lavaan package in R as a reference, but weâ€™ll have to be flexible, too.
